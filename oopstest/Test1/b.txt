Create a C# program that defines an abstract base class Person and an interface IStudent with the following specifications:
 
Abstract Base Class (Person):
 
The Person class should be abstract.
Include five properties: FirstName (string), LastName (string), Age (int), Gender (string), and ContactNumber (long).
Implement a parameterized constructor that initializes the FirstName, LastName, Age, Gender, and ContactNumber properties.
Declare an abstract method named DisplayDetails with no parameters and a return type of void.
 
Interface (IStudent):
 
Declare three methods in the IStudent interface:
EnrollCourse with no parameters and a return type of void.
SubmitAssignment with no parameters and a return type of void.
GetStudentID with no parameters and a return type of string.
 
Derived Class (Student):
 
Inherit from the Person class and implement the IStudent interface.
In the Student class, implement the abstract method DisplayDetails to display the details of the student, including all properties.
Include an additional property in the Student class: StudentID (string).
Implement the methods from the IStudent interface.
 
Main Method:
 
In the Main method, create an instance of the Student class, set its properties, and then call the DisplayDetails method to display the details of the student.
Call the methods from the IStudent interface on the Student instance.
Write the complete C# program to achieve the above requirements.

Create a C# program that defines an abstract base class Employee and an interface IWorker with the following specifications:
 
Abstract Base Class (Employee):
 
The Employee class should be abstract.
Include five properties: Name (string), Salary (Decimal), DOB (DateTime), Gender (string), and ContactNumber (long).
Implement a parameterized constructor that initializes the Name, Salary ,DOB, Gender, and ContactNumber properties.
Declare an abstract method named DisplayDetails with no parameters and a return type of void.
 
Interface (IWorker):
 
Declare three methods in the IWorker interface:
Enrollment with no parameters and a return type of void.
Dispatch with no parameters and a return type of void.
GetworkerID with no parameters and a return type of int.
 
Derived Class (Worker):
 
Inherit from the Employee class and implement the IWorker interface.
In the Worker class, implement the abstract method DisplayDetails to display the details of the worker, including all properties.
Include an additional property in the Worker class: WorkerID (int).
Implement the methods from the IStudent interface.
 
Derived Class (worker2):
 
Inherit from the Worker class and implement the IWorker interface.
In the Worker2 class, implement the abstract method DisplayDetails to display the details of the worker2, including all properties.
Include an additional property in the Worker class: Department (string).
Implement the methods from the IStudent interface.
 
Main Method:
 
In the Main method, create an instance of the Worker2 class, set its properties, and then call the DisplayDetails method to display the details of the worker,worker2.
Call the methods from the IWorker interface on the Worker instance.
Write the complete C# program to achieve the above requirements.
